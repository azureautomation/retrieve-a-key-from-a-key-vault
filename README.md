Retrieve a key from a Key Vault
===============================

            

 

 

This runbook shows how to retrieve a key from an existing Key Vault. It requires an Azure Run As account and additional modules, see the PREREQUISITE sections in the runbook for details. The runbook will use the Run As account to authenticate against Key
 Vault. The access policy of the Key Vault needs to permit reading keys. If successful, the runbook will display information about the new key.


 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
